Your First Journey: Building a High-Converting Website

Welcome to your first guided tour. This document will walk you step-by-step through the platform's intelligent workflow, showing you how to move from a simple idea to a complete, marketing-ready website in minutes. You're about to see how a few strategic choices can create a powerful, conversion-focused asset for your business.

1. Step 1: Declaring Your Goal at the "Start Here" Screen

Your journey begins at the command center, where a single choice sets your entire strategy in motion. This is where you declare your primary goal.

This first choice is critical. By telling the platform your main objective, you trigger a workflow specifically tailored to that goal. Every subsequent step, from the strategy offered to the content that is crafted, will be aligned with this initial intent.

For this guide, we will follow the website creation path.

* Build a Website
* Send SMS Blast
* Ask AI Expert
* Send Emails
* Run Google Ads
* Get FB/Insta Leads
* Get Market Data

Now that you've told the platform what you want to do, the next crucial step is to define who you are as a professional to align the strategy correctly.

2. Step 2: Defining "Your Audience"

After selecting "Build a Website," the platform needs to understand your business model to propose the right strategy.

This step goes far beyond choosing a visual theme. The platform creates fundamentally different website strategies depending on whether you are an individual agent, a large brokerage, or a property developer. Your choice here determines which strategic blueprints you'll see next.

* Brokerage
* Property Developer
* Myself (Agent)
* Marketing Agency

With your audience defined, the platform now presents you with a set of powerful, pre-built strategies called Blueprints.

3. Step 3: Choosing Your Strategy with Blueprints

This screen introduces you to "Blueprints"—a complete business model in a box, containing not just the structure, but the narrative, essential tools, and conversion psychology needed to succeed with your specific audience.

Choose a structure that fits your business model.

This step is where the platform's built-in expertise becomes your strategic advantage. Instead of giving you a blank canvas, it provides battle-tested marketing strategies, turning a month of planning and guesswork into a single, confident click.

Notice how the strategic components differ based on the audience profile:

Strategy for: Myself (Agent)	Strategy for: Property Developer
Simple journey structure (Buy / Invest / Sell)	Project launch blueprint
Includes tools like ROI and valuation request calculators	Includes Payment plan and floorplans logic
Features a trust-first copy style	Features an investor narrative with credibility blocks
Designed for minimal pages with high conversion	Designed for lead capture and brochure download flows

Once you've selected the perfect strategic blueprint, the final step is to provide a few key details so the platform can begin the instant creation of your custom content.

4. Step 4: Providing "Quick Details" for Content Generation

This is the final input screen, where you provide the essential raw materials for the instant creation of your content.

Help us write your content.

The purpose of this screen is to gather the last few pieces of information the platform's Smart Writer needs to craft compelling, relevant content. Think about what's not being asked. No need for long-form content, no need to write headlines. By providing just these four key details, you give the Smart Writer all the context it needs to craft an entire website's worth of targeted, professional copy, perfectly aligned with your chosen strategy.

* Target City/Area
* Who are you targeting? (e.g., Home Buyers, Investors/B2B)
* Main Goal (e.g., Get Leads, Get Calls, WhatsApp Chats)
* Language (e.g., English, Arabic, Both)

5. Step 5: Launch Your Website

Before your site goes live, the platform runs a final check with the Entrestate Refiner. This intelligent system scans for common conversion killers—like poor color contrast, low-quality hero images, or weak calls-to-action—ensuring your website is optimized for performance from the moment it's published.

With all your inputs synthesized and refined, your new marketing asset is ready.

In an instant, the platform has not only built your website but also equipped it for success. The outputs are tangible and immediately valuable:

* Published URL: Your new website is now live on the internet.
* Tracking Setup: Your Meta Pixel, GA4, and conversion events have been automatically configured to measure performance from the very first visitor.

With your website now live and tracking enabled, the platform immediately suggests the most logical next actions to start driving traffic and capturing leads, seamlessly connecting your new asset to powerful marketing channels. To help you capitalize on your launch, the platform presents these powerful next steps:

* Run Meta leads
* Run Google ads
* Start email flow
* Launch SMS reactivation
* Pull market data insights
