# Smart Sender: The Only Follow‑Up Sequence Brokers Should Use

Brokers don’t need “email marketing.” They need **a sequence that lands**.

## One lead, one narrative

A lead should experience one story across channels:

1) Email: the full story (details, files, payment plan, landing link)
2) SMS: a short nudge (“Check your email for full details”)
3) WhatsApp: human follow-up (“Any questions before I schedule a call?”)

## Why this works

You’re not spamming. You’re guiding attention.

Entrestate’s Smart Sender is built around that principle.
