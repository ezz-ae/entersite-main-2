# Why Brokers Trust Google Leads More Than Meta (And How to Use That)

Brokers don’t trust Meta leads because Meta *creates demand*. Google captures it.

## Demand vs intent

- Meta: interruption + persuasion.
- Google: a user literally searching for what they want.

That psychological difference is the trust gap.

## How to win with Google

Stop chasing cheap clicks. Build a clear intent ladder:

1. Location intent (area + property type)
2. Budget intent (price range signals)
3. Decision intent (handover, payment plan, “ready to move”)

Entrestate is built around this ladder, so campaigns can be explained in broker language, not ad-nerd language.
