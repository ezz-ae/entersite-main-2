# Brochure → Landing Page: The Fastest Way to Stop Losing Off-Plan Leads

Brokers lose leads because brochures are dead assets.

A brochure is a PDF. A buyer lives on mobile.

## The execution problem

- PDFs don’t load well on phones.
- WhatsApp links get lost.
- A brochure doesn’t capture a lead.

## The fix

Turn the brochure into a landing page:

- fast mobile layout
- call to action
- lead capture
- tracking
- optional agent + follow-up

This is not design. This is conversion logistics.
