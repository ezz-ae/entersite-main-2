# Google Ads in Real Estate: Expectation Management That Actually Works

Most brokers fail with Google Ads for one reason: they treat it like a button, not a system.

## The truth

Google Ads is not “instant leads.” It is **paid access to intent**. That intent has a cost, a speed, and a quality band.

## What Entrestate does differently

- We translate real estate strategy into campaign structure.
- We set a measurable success definition before spending.
- We report in real estate language (projects, budgets, buyer types), not platform jargon.

## The three bands you must understand

1. **Discovery band** — first signals, higher cost per lead, learning phase.
2. **Stabilization band** — consistent CPL, cleaner filtering, budget efficiency.
3. **Scale band** — incremental budget increases with controlled CPL drift.

If you skip bands, you burn budget and blame Google.
