# The Chat Agent Is Not Smart Hype — It’s Infrastructure

A broker doesn’t need “Smart.” A broker needs **response time**.

Every minute a lead waits, quality drops.

## What the agent is for

- Answer fast
- Capture details
- Route to the right page
- Stop when human takeover is required

## What the agent is NOT

- A chatbot that pretends to be human
- A gimmick
- A replacement for your closing skill

It’s infrastructure. Like a receptionist. But faster.
